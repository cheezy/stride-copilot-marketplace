Activate when the user wants to ideate, brainstorm, scope a new feature, write a requirements doc, design brief, or pre-decomposition scoping doc. Supports --continue <path> to refine a prior requirements doc and --profile <lean|product|discovery|lean-startup> to select the round structure and reviewer rubric (default lean = upstream v0.3.0 behavior). Hard-gated by the stride-ideation skill on the seven required sections; terminal state is the written doc (does NOT auto-activate the stride-ideation-stridify skill).

# stride-ideation-ideate

Drive an interactive ideation session that produces a committed `*-requirements.md` document under `docs/ideation/`. The protocol — round-based question batching, hard-gated sections, advisory reviewer pass — is defined in `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`. This skill is the surface: it parses arguments (or prompts the user for them), captures the session timestamp, resolves the slug, drives the protocol skill, and finishes by writing and committing the doc.

## Activation

Activate this skill when the user:

- Describes a new feature, capability, or initiative in fuzzy terms ("we should probably do X", "what if we…")
- Explicitly asks for a requirements doc, scoping doc, or design brief
- Has a piece of work too broad to decompose into Stride tasks without first capturing the shape
- Is choosing between approaches and needs to articulate goals + constraints before picking one

If the user activates the skill with arguments embedded in the message (e.g., "ideate notifications system" or "ideate --profile=product approval flows" or "ideate --continue docs/ideation/<existing>-requirements.md"), parse those per Step 1. Otherwise prompt for the topic via the platform's question UI.

## What to do

Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip steps.

### Step 1: Parse arguments

The user may pass arguments inline in the activation request (e.g., "ideate --profile=product approval flows", or "ideate --continue docs/ideation/2026-05-12T120000-foo-requirements.md"). If no arguments are present, prompt the user for the topic via the platform's question UI.

Parse arguments in this fixed order — `--continue` first, then `--input`, then `--profile`, then everything remaining is `TOPIC`:

- If `--continue` appears, set `CONTINUE_PATH` to the value of the **next** token and remove both tokens. In `--continue` mode the topic is inherited from the source file and not re-prompted.
- If `--input` appears (accept both `--input <path>` and `--input=<path>` shapes, matching how `--continue` accepts both forms), set `INPUT_PATH` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. `--input` is a **freeform brain-dump seed** — a Slack thread, scratch notes, meeting notes — that pre-populates draft sections; it is **distinct from `--continue`**, which refines an already-committed `-requirements.md` document. The two are independent and composable: if **both** are passed, `--continue` supplies the starting document and `--input` supplies additional raw seed content; neither overrides the other, nothing is silently dropped, and the slug still follows the `--continue` rule below (see Step 3). `--input` never changes the topic or the slug — it only seeds content.
- If `--profile` appears (accept both `--profile <name>` and `--profile=<name>` shapes, matching how `--continue` accepts both forms), set `PROFILE` to the parsed value and remove the consumed tokens. The accepted values are exactly `lean`, `product`, `discovery`, `lean-startup`. If the value is missing or is not one of these four, print a one-line error naming the offending value and the accepted set (e.g., `stride-ideation: unknown --profile value 'foo'; expected one of: lean, product, discovery, lean-startup`) and stop **before any session work begins** — do NOT prompt, do NOT default to lean on a typo, and do NOT fall through to the topic parser.
- If `--profile` is absent, **recommend a profile before the rounds begin** rather than silently defaulting. Ask the user once via the Copilot CLI platform's question UI (the same prompt primitive the skill uses elsewhere — NOT Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`), inferring a suggested profile from the topic (in `--continue` mode, infer from the inherited topic / prior document — never re-elicit the topic) and presenting it using the **"first option = recommended"** convention: the recommended profile is the **first option, labeled `(recommended)`, with a one-line rationale**, followed by the other three profiles as alternatives. The four options are exactly `lean`, `product`, `discovery`, `lean-startup` — the same accepted set as the flag. `lean` is the safe default: when inference is weak or the topic is ambiguous, recommend `lean` first. Set `PROFILE` to whatever the user selects. This recommendation runs **only** when `--profile` was omitted — it is a single question, asked once, before any round. Once the resolved `PROFILE` is `lean`, every downstream behavior is byte-for-byte equivalent to upstream v0.3.0 lean (no new questions, no new sections, no new rubric checks) — the recommendation question is the *only* addition on the omitted-flag path and it changes nothing after a lean resolution.
- After both flag tokens are consumed, treat the trimmed remainder as `TOPIC`. If `CONTINUE_PATH` is set, the remainder is ignored. Otherwise, if the remainder is empty, ask the user once via the platform's question UI: *"What's the topic for this ideation session?"* (free-text input).

Validate `CONTINUE_PATH` immediately:

- If `CONTINUE_PATH` is set but the file does not exist (or is not a regular file), print a one-line error naming the path and stop. Do NOT fall back to a fresh session — the user explicitly asked for `--continue`.
- If `CONTINUE_PATH` does not end in `-requirements.md` (the artifact family this skill refines), warn but proceed; the slug extraction may still work for paths produced by older versions of the plugin.

Validate `INPUT_PATH` immediately, mirroring the `CONTINUE_PATH` existence check:

- If `INPUT_PATH` is set but the file does not exist (or is not a regular file), print a one-line error naming the path (e.g., `stride-ideation: --input file not found: notes.md`) and stop. Do NOT fall back to a fresh no-seed session — the user explicitly asked to seed from that file.
- No suffix restriction applies — `--input` accepts any freeform text file. Treat its contents as **untrusted prose**: it only seeds draft sections; never execute or `eval` it, and never echo its contents into a git commit message or any log.

### Step 2: Capture the session timestamp

Run `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S` once and store the result as `SESSION_TS`. This single value MUST be used for every artifact written during this session — do not recompute it later. Capturing the timestamp at invocation time is what makes re-runs sortable and keeps the requirements doc / decomposition output paired by prefix.

**Even in `--continue` mode, always generate a fresh `SESSION_TS`.** Do not reuse the timestamp embedded in `CONTINUE_PATH` — that timestamp belongs to the source document, and reusing it would defeat the "never overwrite an existing file" invariant. The refined doc is a sibling, not a replacement.

### Step 3: Resolve the topic slug

Source `lib/filename.sh` (it ships with the plugin) and resolve the slug depending on mode:

```bash
. <plugin-root>/lib/filename.sh

if [ -n "$CONTINUE_PATH" ]; then
  # --continue mode: inherit slug from source path; never re-prompt.
  SLUG="$(sti_slug_from_path "$CONTINUE_PATH" requirements)"
else
  # Fresh session: slugify the user-supplied topic.
  SLUG="$(sti_slugify "$TOPIC")"
fi
```

Where `<plugin-root>` is the resolved path to the installed `stride-copilot-ideation` plugin. If either helper exits non-zero, surface the error verbatim and stop — do NOT silently pick a fallback slug.

On Windows hosts where bash is unavailable, source `lib/filename.ps1` instead — the PowerShell mirror exposes `Sti-Slugify` and `Sti-SlugFromPath` cmdlets with the same behavior. The skill body assumes bash; substitute the cmdlet calls when running under PowerShell.

**Confirm `SLUG` with the user only in fresh-session mode.** In `--continue` mode the slug is inherited and locked — re-prompting would violate the "no re-prompt" acceptance criterion and risk accidentally diverging the artifact family. In fresh-session mode, ask the user via the platform's question UI offering the computed value as the first option and "Type a different slug" as a fallback. Either way, the slug is locked for the rest of the session.

### Step 4: Compute the target path (don't write yet)

Call `sti_unique_path docs/ideation "$SESSION_TS" "$SLUG" requirements md`:

```bash
TARGET_PATH="$(sti_unique_path docs/ideation "$SESSION_TS" "$SLUG" requirements md)"
```

`TARGET_PATH` is the path you WILL write to in Step 8. Do NOT create or touch this file yet. Pre-creating it as empty would leave a half-baked artifact on the filesystem if the user interrupts mid-session, which is the explicit failure mode the spec is guarding against.

**HARD INVARIANT — `--continue` mode:** `TARGET_PATH` MUST NOT equal `CONTINUE_PATH`. `sti_unique_path` builds the new path from a fresh `SESSION_TS`, so the two paths only collide if the user manually crafted a colliding name on disk in the same second — which the collision discriminator handles. Verify the invariant before continuing:

```bash
if [ -n "$CONTINUE_PATH" ] && [ "$TARGET_PATH" = "$CONTINUE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "stride-ideation: refusing to overwrite source document at $CONTINUE_PATH" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### Step 4b: Read the prior document (only in `--continue` mode)

If `CONTINUE_PATH` is set, **read-only** load its content via the platform's file-read tool. The skill will receive this content as starting context for the session. The source file is **never** edited, written, moved, or `git add`-ed during this skill — read access only. If you find yourself reaching for the file-edit or file-write tool against `CONTINUE_PATH`, stop: that is the failure mode the pitfall forbids.

In fresh-session mode, leave the prior-doc context empty.

### Step 4c: Read the input brain-dump (only when `--input` is set)

If `INPUT_PATH` is set, **read-only** load its content via the platform's file-read tool into `INPUT_NOTES`. The protocol skill receives this content as raw seed material that pre-populates draft sections wherever the notes clearly map to a gated section. The `--input` file carries the **same read-only invariant as the `--continue` source**: it is **never** edited, written, moved, or `git add`-ed during this skill — read access only. Its contents are untrusted prose: never execute or `eval` them, and never copy them into a commit message or log. If `INPUT_PATH` is not set, leave `INPUT_NOTES` empty.

`--input` and `--continue` are independent: both `PRIOR_DOC` and `INPUT_NOTES` may be non-empty in the same session (a prior committed doc *and* a fresh notes file), one may be set without the other, or neither. The seed lowers the starting cost — it does NOT lower the bar: the hard gates, the round-3 framing checkpoint, the premortem, and the reviewer pass all still run, and gaps or weak sections are still asked in the rounds.

### Step 4d: Detect an unfinished draft and resolve the autosave path

The requirements doc is not written until the hard gate passes (Step 8), so an interruption mid-session would otherwise lose every answer. To make a session recoverable, the skill autosaves the in-progress draft to a **gitignored** scratch file under `.stride/` (see Step 5), and on start it offers to resume any unfinished draft for the **same slug**.

Source the draft helper and look for an existing draft keyed by `SLUG` (resume keys on the slug, not `SESSION_TS`, because a fresh run has a new timestamp). Use `lib/draft.sh` on Unix shells, or its mirror `lib/draft.ps1` (`Sti-DraftFind`) on Windows:

```bash
. <plugin-root>/lib/draft.sh

EXISTING_DRAFT="$(sti_draft_find .stride "$SLUG" 2>/dev/null || true)"
```

`sti_draft_find` returns the latest **non-empty** scratch draft matching `<ts>-$SLUG-draft.md` under `.stride/`, or nothing when none exists (an empty or absent scratch yields no offer — a partial/corrupt draft safely falls back to a fresh session). Resolve `DRAFT_PATH` for this session:

- **If `EXISTING_DRAFT` is non-empty**, ask the user via the platform's question UI (NOT Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) whether to **resume** that draft or **start fresh** (offer "Resume" as the first option). On resume, set `DRAFT_PATH="$EXISTING_DRAFT"` so the session continues autosaving to — and the protocol skill loads from — that same file. On start-fresh, run `sti_draft_clear "$EXISTING_DRAFT"` to discard the abandoned draft, then set `DRAFT_PATH="$(sti_draft_path .stride "$SESSION_TS" "$SLUG")"`.
- **If `EXISTING_DRAFT` is empty** (none found), set `DRAFT_PATH="$(sti_draft_path .stride "$SESSION_TS" "$SLUG")"` — a fresh per-session scratch path.

Only same-slug drafts are ever offered; a draft for a different in-flight topic is never surfaced here. The `.stride/` scratch directory is gitignored (see the project `.gitignore`) and the scratch file is **never** `git add`-ed or committed, and **never** holds the Stride API token or any other secret — it carries only the in-progress draft prose.

### Step 5: Drive the `stride-ideation` protocol skill

Activate the `stride-ideation` skill (the protocol skill ported to `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`) passing the topic, locked slug, session timestamp, target path, the prior document (if any), and the resolved profile. The protocol skill's contract specifies these inputs explicitly:

```
topic=<TOPIC>
slug=<SLUG>
session_ts=<SESSION_TS>
target_path=<TARGET_PATH>
prior_doc=<PRIOR_DOC>
input_notes=<INPUT_NOTES>
draft_path=<DRAFT_PATH>
profile=<PROFILE>
```

When `PRIOR_DOC` is non-empty, the protocol skill starts the session with that content already loaded as context — refining and sharpening rather than re-eliciting every section from scratch. The Q&A loop, the round-3 checkpoint, the hard gates, and the advisory reviewer pass all still run; `--continue` does not lower the bar, only the starting cost.

When `INPUT_NOTES` is non-empty, the protocol skill pre-populates draft sections from that freeform brain-dump wherever the notes clearly map to a gated section, then focuses the rounds on the gaps and weak sections rather than re-eliciting every section from scratch. Seeded content is a *draft starting point*, not a confirmed answer: it never satisfies a hard gate on its own — every gated section the seed pre-fills is still confirmed (or sharpened) with the human in the rounds, and sections the notes do not cover are asked normally. `prior_doc` and `input_notes` are independent and may both be present in one session.

`draft_path=<DRAFT_PATH>` (resolved in Step 4d) is the gitignored scratch file for **intra-session autosave**. The protocol skill persists the in-progress draft — the answered sections plus the round state — to that path via `sti_draft_save` (Unix) / `Sti-DraftSave` (Windows) **after every round**, so an interruption after any round is recoverable rather than losing every answer. If `DRAFT_PATH` already holds content (a resumed draft from Step 4d), the protocol skill loads it as starting context at round 1. The scratch file holds only draft prose: it is gitignored, never `git add`-ed, and never carries the Stride API token or any other secret. Autosave is a recovery convenience, not a gate bypass — the hard gates, framing checkpoint, premortem, and reviewer pass still run in full.

The parsed value of `--profile` from Step 1 is threaded into the protocol skill as `profile=<PROFILE>`. It selects which forcing questions run inside the rounds and which optional sections the document may include. See the **Profiles** subsection of `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md` for the per-profile augmentations. `--profile=lean` (the default) leaves the round loop unchanged from upstream v0.3.0; `--profile=product`, `--profile=discovery`, and `--profile=lean-startup` add advisory rubric checks and (for `product` and `lean-startup`) one optional section.

The protocol skill enforces:
- the hard gate against premature implementation,
- the round-based question loop (≤ 4 questions per round),
- the display-only round recap printed before every round (see **Round recap** in `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`) — it reports per-section solid/thin/empty status and the round's target sections without changing the gate, the round order, or the question budget,
- the "I'm not sure — propose candidates" uncertainty path offered on every batched question — gated-section and profile-specific forcing questions alike (see **Uncertainty path** in `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`); it proposes 2–4 topic-tailored candidates but can never satisfy the hard gate without human confirmation,
- the mandatory round-3 framing checkpoint,
- the mandatory round-4 premortem,
- the mandatory round-5 MVP design (lean-startup profile only),
- the mandatory challenge gate (run after the premortem — and after Round 5 under lean-startup — and before the reviewer pass) — its four components (assumption-confidence audit, blind-spot scan, two alternatives, trade-off analysis) are surfaced to the human via the Copilot CLI selection primitive as a multi-select: one option per low-confidence assumption, one per material blind spot, one per alternative worth pursuing, plus an explicit "Challenge nothing — write as-is" option; at most one refinement round follows the human's selection; the gate is profile-independent and advisory and never blocks the write, and its confidence ratings annotate Assumptions in place while its blind spots, alternatives, and trade-off table fold into the optional "Design challenge" section (see **Challenge gate** in `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`),
- the seven hard-gated sections (Goal, Problem, Outcome, Assumptions, Constraints, Non-goals, Success Metrics),
- the advisory `requirements-reviewer` agent pass before the write — its findings are surfaced to the human as a selectable decision via the Copilot CLI selection primitive (each finding one line, severity-tagged, plus an explicit "Address none — write as-is" option) that feeds the at-most-one refinement round; an `approved` verdict with no findings shows no prompt, and the reviewer never blocks the write (see **Reviewer pass** in `skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md`).

When the protocol skill returns, you will have a single string `DRAFT_DOC` containing the fully composed requirements markdown — every gated section present and substantive. If the protocol skill returns without a draft (user aborted, hard gate not satisfied), stop here and exit cleanly — do NOT write anything to disk and do NOT commit.

### Step 6: Conform the draft to the spec template

The protocol skill returns prose for each section but the on-disk format is fixed by the design spec's "Output: requirements markdown template". Ensure `DRAFT_DOC` looks like:

```markdown
# <Topic>

*Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM*
*Session: <SESSION_TS>-<SLUG>*

## Problem
<one paragraph max>

## Goal
<outcome, not feature>

## Success metrics
- **leading indicators** (observable while the work is in flight, predict the outcome):
  - <bulleted, each measurable>
- **lagging indicators** (the outcome itself, observable only after it has occurred):
  - <bulleted, each measurable>

## Assumptions
*Ordered highest to lowest risk; the riskiest entry is marked `(R)` (or `**(riskiest)**`).*
- <riskiest assumption> (R)
- <next-riskiest assumption>
- <remaining assumptions, in decreasing risk>

## Constraints
- <bullets — non-negotiable>

## Non-goals
- <bullets, each with a reason>

## Outcome
<what the world looks like after this ships>

## Sketch
<optional; 1–5 paragraphs if present>

## Open questions
<optional; bullets of deferred items>
```

The seven hard-gated sections appear above the two optional ones (`Sketch`, `Open questions`). Include the optional sections only if the conversation produced substantive content for them. If the draft is missing any gated section, treat that as a protocol-skill bug and abort — do NOT paper over it by writing an incomplete doc.

**Decomposition seams (optional, freeform).** If the conversation surfaced that the work splits across multiple independent surfaces — separate plugins, separate services, separate repos that ship on their own cadences — append a freeform `## Decomposition seams` section after the optional sections. List each surface as a numbered markdown item with a bold name, e.g. `1. **Kanban app** — owns the JSON contract`, `2. **stride plugin** — adapter for the reference workflow`. The section is freeform and the protocol skill does NOT gate it. Its downstream consumer is `stride-ideation-stridify --goal <name|index>`: when a requirements doc has many surfaces, the user can activate the stride-ideation-stridify skill once per surface (`stridify <path> --goal 1`, `stridify <path> --goal 2`, …) to reduce per-dispatch prompt size and the blast radius of a single subagent failure. The stride-ideation-stridify skill also prints a one-line preflight advisory suggesting `--goal` when the section enumerates more than 3 surfaces. Producing a Decomposition seams section here is the natural way for the user to discover the partitioning flag.

**Under `profile=lean-startup` only**, append one more optional section after `## Open questions` — `## MVP / Validation experiment` — produced by the Round 5 MVP-design batch. Its sub-fields, in order:

- **Riskiest assumption being tested:** quote the `(R)`-marked entry from Assumptions verbatim.
- **Experiment design:** what to build, fake, or measure to produce the validating signal.
- **Success criteria:** observable signal that validates the assumption.
- **Failure criteria:** observable signal that falsifies the assumption.
- **Time box:** when results are expected.
- **Pivot-or-persevere decision:** what happens based on result.

This `MVP / Validation experiment` section is profile-conditional — under `lean`, `product`, or `discovery` it MUST NOT appear even if the user volunteered experiment-shaped content. The riskiest-assumption line is a quote of an existing Assumptions entry, not a freshly authored field; the other five sub-fields are authored from the Round 5 answers.

### Step 7: Verify the target path is still untaken

Re-run `sti_unique_path` with the same arguments as Step 4 and confirm the returned path equals `TARGET_PATH`. If it differs (another process wrote a colliding file during the session), use the new value — never overwrite an existing file. This is the HARD INVARIANT documented in `lib/filename.sh`.

### Step 8: Write the file

Use the platform's file-write tool to write `DRAFT_DOC` to the resolved target path. The directory `docs/ideation/` may not exist on a fresh repo; create it via `mkdir -p docs/ideation` before the write if Step 4's path resolution depended on it.

### Step 9: Commit

```bash
git add "$TARGET_PATH"
if [ -n "$CONTINUE_PATH" ]; then
  git commit -m "stride-ideation: refine requirements for $SLUG"
else
  git commit -m "stride-ideation: requirements for $SLUG"
fi

# The session succeeded — the committed doc supersedes the scratch draft.
# Delete the gitignored autosave file (sti_draft_clear / Sti-DraftClear) so no
# stale draft lingers to be offered for resume next time. Idempotent: a no-op
# if the draft was never written.
sti_draft_clear "$DRAFT_PATH"
```

Commit message format: `stride-ideation: requirements for <slug>` (fresh) or `stride-ideation: refine requirements for <slug>` (continue). Do not include the session timestamp in the message — the filename already carries it.

The `sti_draft_clear "$DRAFT_PATH"` call (or `Sti-DraftClear` on Windows) runs **only after the commit succeeds** — the scratch draft is the recovery artifact, so it survives until the real doc is committed and is then removed so no stale autosave is offered for resume on a future run. The scratch file lives under the gitignored `.stride/` directory and is never part of the commit's file list.

If the working tree had unrelated uncommitted changes before the session, the commit MUST include only the new requirements doc. Use `git add <path>` (not `git add -A` or `git commit -a`) to avoid sweeping unrelated work into this commit. In `--continue` mode the source document MUST NOT appear in the commit's file list (it was not modified, so `git status` will already show it clean — but verify nothing accidental crept in).

### Step 10: Print the neutral terminal message

Print **exactly** these three lines, substituting the resolved path:

> Requirements written to `<TARGET_PATH>`.
> You can stop here — the doc is the deliverable.
> Or, to decompose this into Stride tasks and ship them in one shot, activate the `stride-ideation-stridify` skill against `<TARGET_PATH>` next.

Do NOT add follow-up suggestions, do NOT auto-activate the stride-ideation-stridify skill, do NOT propose implementation steps. The terminal state is the written document.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Decomposition into Stride tasks AND shipping to a Stride workspace in one shot — see `skills/stride-ideation-stridify/SKILL.md`.
- Modifying any file other than the new requirements doc — pre-existing files (including a `--continue` source document) are read-only.
