# Tests that the artifact commits in the two surface skills commit ONLY the
# artifact: ideate Step 9 (the requirements doc) and stridify Step 8d (the
# batch JSON).
#
# The exact fenced blocks are extracted from the skills, their
# '<value of NAME>' placeholders filled with fixture values, and run in a
# scratch git repository where an unrelated file was staged before the
# session. A plain `git commit` would record that file too; the blocks pass
# the artifact as a pathspec after `--`, so it must stay staged and out of the
# new commit. Each case runs both in a repository with history and in one
# with no prior commits.
#
# Run:
#   ./lib/test-commit-scope.sh
#
# Exits 0 if all tests pass, non-zero otherwise.
