# Tests for the challenge-gate output shape documented in the
# "## Challenge gate" section of skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md and
# surfaced in skills/stride-ideation-ideate/SKILL.md. The gate is an
# interactive question/selection step (the Copilot CLI question primitive,
# never Claude Code's AskUserQuestion) that cannot be driven from a
# non-interactive runner, so this test asserts the *output contract* — the
# shape a committed requirements doc must exhibit once the gate has run —
# against the committed fixture
# fixtures/2026-05-12T120300-saved-filters-challenge-gate-requirements.md.
#
# The shape assertions below MUST stay consistent with the "Challenge gate"
# section of skills/stride-ideation/SKILL.md and the optional "## Design
# challenge" section it folds into. If you change the documented gate output,
# update this test and the fixture together — this test exists to catch drift
# between the documented contract and a real example of its output.
#
# Run:
#   ./lib/test-challenge-gate.sh
#
# Exits 0 if all tests pass, non-zero otherwise. No network, no external deps.
