"""Strip local-audit fields from a Stride batch JSON document.

Usage:
    python3 lib/strip_audit_fields.py <path-to-stride-batch.json>

Reads the file at the given path, removes the three local-audit fields
(`source_spec`, `source_spec_sha256`, `decomposition_notes`) that the
stride-ideation-stridify skill stamped at the root, and prints the
API-ready payload to stdout. Exits 0 on success.

The resulting JSON is what the stride-ideation-stridify skill POSTs to
Stride's `/api/tasks/batch` endpoint. The three stripped fields are
useful for local audit and drift detection but the Stride API does
not accept them and silently drops them — better to strip
explicitly so the on-the-wire payload matches the API contract.

Exits 1 with a stderr message if the file cannot be read or parsed.
Field-shape validation is NOT performed here — that is the job of
`lib/validate_batch.py`. Run the validator before stripping.

The per-goal `created_by_agent` attribution field is intentionally NOT in
`LOCAL_AUDIT_FIELDS`: it is a create-payload field the Stride API accepts and
persists for the `/agents` activity feed, so it must survive this strip and
reach the wire. Adding it here would silently un-attribute every shipped batch.
