# stride-ideation: ship a validated batch JSON to Stride in ONE process —
# the PowerShell twin of lib/ship.sh, with the same modes, messages and exit
# codes.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File lib/ship.ps1 -CheckAuth     (or --check-auth)
#       Step 3 preflight: read auth, POST nothing
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File lib/ship.ps1 -CheckPayload <batch.json>  (or --check-payload)
#       Step 8a: refuse decomposer output that contains the token, POST nothing
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File lib/ship.ps1 -Batch <batch.json>  (or just <batch.json>)
#       Steps 9-10: strip, POST, branch, render
#
# Auth file: $env:STRIDE_AUTH_FILE if set, else .stride_auth.md at the git
# toplevel of the working directory, or in the current directory outside a
# git repository.
#
# The token lives only in this process's memory:
#   - never on any process's argv: lib/read_auth.py prints it to this script's
#     captured stdout, and every python helper that needs it reads it on stdin;
#   - the POST is made in-process by System.Net.Http.HttpClient with the
#     header set on the request object, never logged, and with redirects
#     disabled so the header can never follow a 3xx to another host;
#   - every response body or transport message printed is first scrubbed of
#     the token and of any "Bearer <value>" (lib/ship_support.py scrub);
#   - every temp file (payload, response) is removed in a finally block.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  shipped (2xx) — including a 2xx whose body could not be rendered, which
#      prints a do-not-re-run notice: the batch exists, re-running would
#      create it twice
#   1  auth unreadable, payload unpreparable, transport failure, or non-2xx
#   2  usage error
#
# The POST is never retried: Stride does not guarantee idempotency on a
# partially-failed batch.
#
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatible: no ternary, no null-coalescing,
# two-argument Join-Path only.

# Like ship.sh's `set +xva`: a caller's `Set-PSDebug -Trace` would print the
# line that holds the token. -Off must come before Set-StrictMode, which it
# would otherwise reset.
