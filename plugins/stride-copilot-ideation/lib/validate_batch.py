"""Validate a Stride batch JSON document produced by the stride-ideation-stridify skill.

Usage:
    python3 lib/validate_batch.py <path-to-stride-batch.json>

Exits 0 on success; advisory warnings (see below) print to stdout and never
change the exit code.
Exits 1 on the first violation, printing a single line of the form:

    stride-ideation: <error message naming the failing JSON path>

The named fatal error variants:

  (a) parse_error           - input is not valid JSON
  (b) wrong_root_key        - root has 'tasks' or any key other than 'goals'
  (c) empty_goals           - 'goals' is missing, not an array, or empty
  (d) goal_missing_field    - a goal entry lacks title, type, or tasks
  (e) bad_dependency_index  - a task's dependencies[] index references an
                              array slot that does not exist OR points to a
                              task at or after the referencing task's own
                              position (forward reference)
  (f) length_limit          - a goal/task title or a security_considerations
                              element exceeds 255 Unicode code points — the
                              server binds these to varchar(255) and rejects
                              longer values with an opaque error

After all fatal checks pass, an ADVISORY scored-field completeness pass
warns (stdout, prefix "stride-ideation: warning:") for any task whose
review-queue scored field (acceptance_criteria, testing_strategy,
security_considerations, pitfalls, patterns_to_follow) is missing or empty —
each renders an empty review-queue pill once the task ships. Warnings are
non-fatal by design: the exit code stays 0, so decomposition can still be
shipped without every field.

Beyond (f) and the advisory pass, the validator still does NOT enforce
per-task Stride-API field shapes (pitfalls-as-array-of-strings,
verification_steps-as-objects, etc.). Those are the decomposer agent's
responsibility; the stride-ideation-stridify skill's Step 9 POST surfaces the
API's own error if anything slips through. Length is checked ONLY on the fields
the server actually bounds:
title (goal and task) and each security_considerations element. pitfalls
elements and key_files notes are JSONB on the server (unbounded) — checking
them would reject batches the server accepts.
