# stride-ideation: ship a validated batch JSON to Stride in ONE process.
#
# Usage:
#   bash lib/ship.sh --check-auth      # Step 3 preflight: read auth, POST nothing
#   bash lib/ship.sh --check-payload <batch.json>
#                                      # Step 8a: refuse decomposer output that
#                                      # contains the token, POST nothing
#   bash lib/ship.sh <batch.json>      # Steps 9-10: strip, POST, branch, render
#
# Auth file: $STRIDE_AUTH_FILE if set, else .stride_auth.md at the git toplevel
# of the working directory (so a run from a subdirectory still finds it), or
# in $PWD outside a git repository.
#
# Why one script: the stride-ideation-stridify skill's Steps 3, 9 and 10 used
# to be separate bash fragments the model ran in separate shell calls. Shell state does not
# persist between those calls, so the token had to be re-read (or pasted) for
# the POST, and the fragments put it on curl's command line. Here the token
# lives only in this shell's memory and in a pipe to curl:
#
#   - never on any process's argv (argv is visible to `ps`), never in a file,
#     and never in a child's environment (an inherited export is dropped);
#   - never on stdout or stderr: xtrace is forced off, and every response body
#     or curl message printed is first scrubbed of the token and of any
#     `Bearer <value>` (a dev server's debug error page echoes request
#     headers);
#   - the payload goes out with --data-binary from a file, not -d "<json>";
#   - every temp file (payload, response, curl stderr) is created mode 600
#     under the system temp dir and removed on success, failure and interrupt.
#
# The payload is validated with lib/validate_batch.py in this process before
# anything is sent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  shipped (2xx) — including a 2xx whose body could not be rendered, which
#      prints a do-not-re-run notice: the batch exists, re-running would
#      create it twice
#   1  auth unreadable, payload unpreparable, transport failure, or non-2xx
#   2  usage error
#   129/130/143  interrupted (HUP/INT/TERM); if the POST was in flight the
#      batch may exist
#
# The POST is never retried: Stride does not guarantee idempotency on a
# partially-failed batch.

# A caller's `bash -x` or exported SHELLOPTS=xtrace would print every line
# that handles the token, and `bash -a` / SHELLOPTS=allexport would export it
# into every child's environment. Turn all three off before anything runs.

umask 077

# Drop any inherited copy: eval below would otherwise update an EXPORTED
# variable, and every child started afterwards would carry the token in its
# environment (readable with `ps -E`).
