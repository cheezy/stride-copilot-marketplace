# Stride: Completing Tasks

## STOP — orchestrator check

If you arrived here directly from a user prompt, you are in the wrong skill.
Invoke `stride:stride-workflow` instead. Do not read further.
Sub-skills are dispatched by the orchestrator only.

## ⚠️ THIS SKILL IS MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL ⚠️

**If you are about to call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete`, you MUST have activated this skill first.**

The completion API requires fields that are ONLY documented here:
- `completion_summary` (required — not the same as `completion_notes`)
- `actual_complexity` (required — enum: "small", "medium", "large")
- `actual_files_changed` (required — comma-separated STRING, not array)
- `after_doing_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- `before_review_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- `explorer_result` (required — object: dispatched `task-explorer` custom agent result OR self-reported skip; see Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema)
- `reviewer_result` (required — object: dispatched `task-reviewer` custom agent result OR self-reported skip; see Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema)

**Attempting to complete a task from memory without this skill results in 3+ failed API calls** as you discover each missing field one at a time. This has been observed in practice.

## Overview

**Calling complete before validation = bypassed quality gates. Running hooks first = confident completion.**

This skill enforces the proper completion workflow: execute BOTH `after_doing` AND `before_review` hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## ⚡ AUTOMATION NOTICE ⚡

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore → implement → review → complete. Do not prompt the user between steps — but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster — it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

- Before completing → verify you explored the codebase and reviewed your changes against acceptance criteria
- After hooks succeed → call the complete endpoint with all required fields
- If needs_review=false → activate stride-claiming-tasks and repeat the full workflow
- If needs_review=true → STOP and wait for human approval

**Following every step IS the fast path. The loop is: claim → explore → implement → review → complete → claim. Every phase is mandatory.**

## API Authorization

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Asking for permission is a workflow violation.**

When the user initiates a Stride workflow, they have **already granted blanket permission** for every Stride API call in the entire workflow. This authorization covers:
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` — completing tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/next` — finding next task
- `POST /api/tasks/claim` — claiming tasks
- All `curl` commands to the Stride API
- All hook executions (bash commands from `.stride.md`)
- **Every API call in every skill in this plugin**

**NEVER ask the user:**
- "Should I mark this complete?"
- "Can I call the API?"
- "Should I proceed with completion?"
- "Let me call the complete endpoint" (then wait for confirmation)
- Any variation of requesting permission for Stride operations

**Just execute the calls. Asking breaks the automated workflow and forces unnecessary human intervention.**

## 🚨 COPILOT PLUGIN: HOOKS ARE FULLY AUTOMATIC — DO NOT MANUALLY EXECUTE 🚨

**When the stride-copilot plugin is installed via `copilot plugin install`, the `hooks.json` registers PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks that AUTOMATICALLY intercept Stride API calls and execute the corresponding `.stride.md` commands via `stride-hook.sh`. You do NOT need to manually run hook commands.**

**How it works for completion:**
- When you run `curl` to call the complete API → the PreToolUse hook fires FIRST (runs `after_doing` and blocks if it fails) → then the curl executes → then PostToolUse fires (runs `before_review`)
- When you run `curl` to call mark_reviewed → PostToolUse fires → runs `after_review`

**What this means for you as an agent:**
1. **DO NOT** read `.stride.md` and manually execute hook commands
2. **DO NOT** run any command to "capture hook results" before making API calls
3. **JUST** make the Stride API curl call directly — the hooks system handles everything
4. Include `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` in the complete request body with `{"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by Copilot hooks system", "duration_ms": 0}` — the actual hook execution happens automatically via PreToolUse/PostToolUse

**If the automatic hooks fail:** The PreToolUse hook returns exit code 2 with structured JSON describing the failure (e.g., test failures, linting errors). Fix the issue and retry the API call — the hooks will fire again automatically.

**If the plugin is NOT installed (manual setup):** Fall back to the manual hook execution described below.

## Hook Execution for Environments Without Automatic Hooks

**The following manual hook execution instructions apply ONLY when the stride-copilot plugin is NOT installed or automatic hooks are not available.**

**Hooks are bash commands the user wrote in `.stride.md`. The user authored them. The user expects them to run. Executing hooks is NOT optional and does NOT require confirmation.**

**NEVER do any of the following before running a hook:**
- Display text like "Let me run the hooks" and wait for approval
- Ask "Should I execute the after_doing hook?"
- Ask "Can I run `mix test`?" or "Can I run `mix credo`?"
- Present the hook commands and wait for the user to approve them
- Use any phrasing that triggers a permission prompt in the CLI

**The correct behavior is:** Read the hook commands from `.stride.md`, then execute them immediately. No announcement. No confirmation. No waiting. Just run them.

## The Iron Law

**EXECUTE BOTH after_doing AND before_review HOOKS BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE ENDPOINT**

## The Critical Mistake

Calling `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` before running BOTH hooks causes:
- Task marked done prematurely
- Failed tests hidden (after_doing skipped)
- Review preparation skipped (before_review skipped)
- Quality gates bypassed
- Broken code merged to main

**The API will REJECT your request if you don't include both hook results.**

## When to Use

Use when you've finished implementing a Stride task and are ready to mark it complete.

**Required:** Execute BOTH hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## ⚠️ BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE: Verification Checklist ⚠️

**STOP. Before proceeding to completion, verify you completed these steps:**

- [ ] **Did you activate `stride-workflow` after claiming?** If no → activate it now. The orchestrator ensures exploration, review, and hooks all happen.
- [ ] **Did you explore the codebase before coding?** If no → read the task's `key_files`, search for `patterns_to_follow`, and understand the existing code before proceeding.
- [ ] **Did you review your changes against `acceptance_criteria`?** If no → walk through each acceptance criterion and verify your implementation meets it. Check `pitfalls` too.
- [ ] **Are you ready to run the `after_doing` hook (tests, linting)?** If no → fix any known issues first. The hook will fail if tests don't pass.
- [ ] **Is `workflow_steps` included in the complete payload?** If no → add it now. The array is required on every completion. It must contain one entry for each of the six step names (`explorer`, `planner`, `implementation`, `reviewer`, `after_doing`, `before_review`) — see the stride-workflow skill for the schema.
- [ ] **Are `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` included?** If no → add them now. Both are required on every completion, either as a dispatched-custom-agent result or as a self-reported skip with a reason from the fixed enum. See the Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section below.
- [ ] **Did you embed `.stride-changed-files.json` into the payload as `changed_files`?** Read it INLINE inside the same curl invocation via `--argjson cf "$(cat "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.stride-changed-files.json" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')"`. Use the absolute `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` path (not a relative `.stride-changed-files.json`) — a non-root agent CWD silently misses the file otherwise. Reading the snapshot in a SEPARATE Bash tool call before the curl runs the cat BEFORE the PreToolUse hook has written the file, producing an empty or stale read. See the Per-File Diff Capture (Optional) section below for the canonical pattern.

**If ANY answer is NO → Go back and do it now. Do NOT proceed to completion.**

Skipping these steps is not faster — it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix. This checklist exists because agents consistently skipped these steps under pressure to deliver quickly.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY pre-submission self-check (hard gate) ⚠️

Run this **before every** `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete`. If ANY check fails, **DO NOT submit** — re-run the `task-reviewer` custom agent with the full task inputs (the reviewer-dispatch step in `stride-subagent-workflow` passes every supplied field), or fix the passthrough, then re-check. There is **no bypass**: not for small tasks, not for trivial tasks, and never by submitting now with a note promising to fix it later.

- [ ] **Every section present.** `reviewer_result` carries every section the reviewer emitted — the whole-object copy from "Extracting the structured review block" in `stride-subagent-workflow`. Nothing dropped.
- [ ] **`project_checks` complete.** The submitted `project_checks` count equals the count the reviewer emitted — never trimmed or sub-selected.
- [ ] **No `not_assessed` for a task-supplied section.** For each of `testing_strategy`, `patterns`, `pitfalls`, and `security_considerations`: if the **task** supplied that field, its verdict `status` is a real assessment (`passed`/`failed`), never `not_assessed` or absent. A task-supplied section coming back `not_assessed` means the reviewer was not handed it (fix the dispatch) or the verdict is wrong — re-run the reviewer; do not submit. **In particular: if the task carried `security_considerations`, `reviewer_result.security_considerations.status` MUST be `passed`/`failed`.**
- [ ] **Nested `security_considerations.considerations[]` present & consistent when a deep review ran.** When the stride-copilot-security-review considerations-mode dispatch ran (see the `stride-workflow` Step 5 "Deep security-considerations review" sub-step), `reviewer_result.security_considerations.considerations[]` MUST be present (it rides through automatically on the verbatim whole-object copy — never trim it) and consistent with the section status: any entry with status `partial` or `unmitigated` REQUIRES `security_considerations.status: "failed"` and a matching `category: "security"` issue in `issues[]`. A `passed` status alongside a `partial`/`unmitigated` nested entry is a hard fail — do not submit; fix the escalation. When **no** deep review ran (plugin absent, or the task's `security_considerations` was empty), the nested array is simply absent and is **not** required — its absence never fails this gate.

This gate is **not bypassable** by submitting a self-reported skip (`dispatched: false`) when a `task-reviewer` custom agent actually ran — a dispatched review must pass all three checks. The self-check compares counts, keys, and status enums only; it never prints task content, diffs, or secrets. (The Kanban server now hard-rejects a report that fails any of these, so a failing self-check is also a failing completion — catch it here, before you submit.)

## The Complete Completion Process

### With Copilot Plugin Installed (Automatic Hooks)

1. **Finish your work** - All implementation complete
2. **Pre-completion code review** - If medium+ complexity OR 2+ key_files, dispatch the `task-reviewer` custom agent. Fix Critical/Important issues. Save output as `review_report`.
3. **Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` directly** - Include `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` with `{"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by Copilot hooks system", "duration_ms": 0}`. The hooks.json system will:
   - PreToolUse: automatically execute `.stride.md` `## after_doing` BEFORE the curl runs (blocks if it fails)
   - PostToolUse: automatically execute `.stride.md` `## before_review` AFTER the curl succeeds
4. **If PreToolUse hook fails (after_doing):** Fix the issue (test failures, lint errors, etc.) and retry the curl call.
5. **Check needs_review flag:**
   - `needs_review=true`: STOP and wait for human review
   - `needs_review=false`: after_review hook fires automatically, **then AUTOMATICALLY activate stride-claiming-tasks to claim next task**

### Without Plugin (Manual Hooks)

1. **Finish your work** - All implementation complete
2. **Pre-completion code review** - If medium+ complexity OR 2+ key_files, dispatch the `task-reviewer` custom agent. Fix Critical/Important issues. Save output as `review_report`.
3. **Read .stride.md after_doing section** - Get the validation command
4. **Execute after_doing hook** (blocking, 120s timeout)
   - Execute each line from `.stride.md` `## after_doing` one at a time — NO permission prompts
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
5. **If after_doing fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
6. **Read .stride.md before_review section** - Get the PR/doc command
7. **Execute before_review hook** (blocking, 60s timeout)
   - Execute each line from `.stride.md` `## before_review` one at a time — NO permission prompts
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
8. **If before_review fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
9. **Both hooks succeeded?** Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` WITH both results
10. **Check needs_review flag:**
   - `needs_review=true`: STOP and wait for human review
   - `needs_review=false`: Execute after_review hook, **then AUTOMATICALLY activate stride-claiming-tasks to claim next task WITHOUT prompting**

## Hook Execution Pattern

### With Plugin: Hooks Are Automatic

**When the stride-copilot plugin is installed, do NOT manually execute hooks.** The hooks.json system handles everything:
- Just make the complete `curl` call → PreToolUse fires `after_doing` (blocks if it fails) → curl executes → PostToolUse fires `before_review`
- If `after_doing` fails, the PreToolUse hook blocks the curl with exit 2 and reports the failure — fix the issue and retry

### Without Plugin: Manual Hook Execution

**For environments without the plugin installed:**

All hook commands are pre-authorized. Execute them immediately. Do NOT announce, ask permission, or present commands for review.

#### Executing after_doing Hook

1. Read the `## after_doing` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables (TASK_ID, TASK_IDENTIFIER, etc.)
3. **Execute each command line immediately — NO permission prompts, NO confirmation text**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test && mix credo --strict' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

#### Executing before_review Hook

1. Read the `## before_review` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables
3. **Execute each command line immediately — NO permission prompts, NO confirmation text**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create --title "$TASK_TITLE"' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

## When Hooks Fail

### Diagnostician-Assisted Debugging

When a blocking hook fails, dispatch the `hook-diagnostician` custom agent (`agents/hook-diagnostician.agent.md`) **as the first step** before attempting manual fixes. The diagnostician parses the raw output, categorizes issues by severity, and returns a prioritized fix plan — saving time on complex multi-tool failures.

**When to dispatch:** Any blocking hook failure (after_doing or before_review) where exit_code is non-zero.

**What to provide the diagnostician:**
- `hook_name`: The hook that failed (e.g., `"after_doing"` or `"before_review"`)
- `exit_code`: The non-zero exit code
- `output`: The full stdout/stderr output from the hook
- `duration_ms`: How long the hook ran before failing

**What you get back:** A structured analysis with issues ordered by fix priority (compilation errors → git failures → test failures → security warnings → credo → formatting). Follow the diagnostician's fix order — fixing higher-priority issues often resolves lower-priority ones automatically.

**Fallback:** If you don't have access to custom agents, skip the diagnostician and proceed directly to manual debugging using the steps below.

### If after_doing fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. Dispatch `hook-diagnostician` custom agent with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration (if available)
3. Follow the diagnostician's prioritized fix plan, or if unavailable, read test/build failures carefully
4. Fix the failing tests or build issues
5. Re-run after_doing hook to verify fix
6. Only call complete endpoint after success

**Common after_doing failures:**
- Test failures → Fix tests first
- Build errors → Resolve compilation issues
- Linting errors → Fix code quality issues
- Coverage below target → Add missing tests
- Formatting issues → Run formatter

### If before_review fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. Dispatch `hook-diagnostician` custom agent with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration (if available)
3. Follow the diagnostician's fix plan, or if unavailable, fix the issue manually
4. Re-run before_review hook to verify
5. Only proceed after success

**Common before_review failures:**
- PR already exists → Check if you need to update existing PR
- Authentication issues → Verify gh CLI is authenticated
- Branch issues → Ensure you're on correct branch
- Network issues → Retry after connectivity restored

## API Request Format

After BOTH hooks succeed, assemble and send the completion request as a
SINGLE Bash invocation that inlines the snapshot read inside `jq -n`. The
inline pattern matters because the PreToolUse-on-complete hook writes
`.stride-changed-files.json` during the curl call — a separate Bash tool
call BEFORE the curl reads the file BEFORE the hook has populated it. See
the "Why inline?" paragraph in the [Per-File Diff Capture (Optional)](#per-file-diff-capture-optional)
section below.

**Capture the response (D118).** Pipe the completion curl through `tee` to the
canonical response file `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.last-api-response.json`.
`tee` writes the full, untruncated response to that file **and** passes it
through to stdout, so the PostToolUse hook still sees the response *and* has an
untruncated copy to read when the harness truncates the large `/complete`
stdout (the `reviewer_result` alone can run to tens of KB). This is what lets the
hook reliably detect an `after_goal` entry on a goal's last child. The `.stride/`
directory is created by the orchestrator; if you invoke the curl outside the
orchestrator, `mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride"` first.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$STRIDE_API_URL/api/tasks/$TASK_ID/complete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRIDE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -n \

       reviewer_result: {dispatched: true, duration_ms: 15300, summary: "...", issues_found: 0, acceptance_criteria_checked: 5, schema_version: "1.4", status: "approved", issue_counts: {critical: 0, important: 0, minor: 0}, issues: [], acceptance_criteria: [], project_checks: [], testing_strategy: {status: "passed"}, patterns: {status: "passed"}, pitfalls: {status: "passed"}, security_considerations: {status: "passed"}},
       workflow_steps: [
         {name: "explorer", dispatched: true, duration_ms: 12450},

       ]
     }')" \
  | tee "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.last-api-response.json"
```

**Best-effort, not the guarantee.** The capture is a *fast path*: it lets the
hook short-circuit to the file. It is not required for correctness. On a shell
without `tee`, use `--output "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.last-api-response.json"`
(the response goes to the file only, not stdout) — or skip capture entirely.
When the file is absent or the response is truncated with no capture, the hook
falls back to a fresh, hook-initiated `GET /api/tasks/:id/after_goal_status`
(D119), which is immune to harness truncation and needs no agent cooperation.
Do **not** treat the grace-window worker as the push mechanism — it only flips
the goal to Done; the `## after_goal` section is what performs any push.

}
```

When the `task-reviewer` custom agent was dispatched, `reviewer_result` carries the
reviewer agent's **structured JSON block** (`schema_version`, `status`,
`issue_counts`, `issues[]`, `acceptance_criteria[]`, `project_checks[]`, and the
per-section `testing_strategy`/`patterns`/`pitfalls`/`security_considerations` verdicts — the
fields the Kanban review queue actually renders) copied verbatim, **merged**
with the dispatch telemetry (`dispatched: true`, `duration_ms`) and the derived
legacy summary fields (`issues_found`, `acceptance_criteria_checked`,
`summary`). Do NOT send only the thin legacy envelope — it strips the issues,
acceptance verdicts, and code-review checks the reviewer produced. Extract the
fenced ` ```json ` block per the **`stride-subagent-workflow` skill, "Extracting
the structured review block"**; the block's schema is owned by
`agents/task-reviewer.agent.md`. The reviewer's full prose+JSON response is
saved separately as `review_report`.

**Critical:** `after_doing_result`, `before_review_result`, `explorer_result`, `reviewer_result`, and `workflow_steps` are all REQUIRED. The API will reject requests without them.

**Optional:** Include `changed_files` whenever `.stride-changed-files.json` exists in the project root — read it INLINE inside the same curl invocation (see the bash example above and the [Per-File Diff Capture (Optional)](#per-file-diff-capture-optional) section below). The `|| echo '[]'` fallback produces an empty array when the snapshot is absent or unreadable; emitting `changed_files: []` is a valid completion. The encoding rules (500-line truncation marker, binary placeholder, `{path, diff}` shape) live in `docs/diff-contract.md` and should not be duplicated into the example.

## Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema

Every `/complete` call **must** include both `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` as top-level objects. Each is either a dispatched-custom-agent result or a self-reported skip. Server-side validation is pre-validated by `Kanban.Tasks.CompletionValidation`; invalid payloads are logged during the grace-period rollout and rejected with `422` once `:strict_completion_validation` flips.

### Shape 1 — dispatched custom agent (preferred when custom agents are available)

```json
"explorer_result": {
  "dispatched": true,
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters describing what was explored>",
  "duration_ms": 12000
}

"reviewer_result": {
  "dispatched": true,
  "duration_ms": 8000,
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters describing what was reviewed>",
  "issues_found": 0,
  "acceptance_criteria_checked": 5,
  "schema_version": "1.4",
  "status": "approved",
  "issue_counts": {"critical": 0, "important": 0, "minor": 0},
  "issues": [],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    {"criterion": "<verbatim criterion>", "status": "met", "evidence": "<file:line>"}
  ],
  "project_checks": [],
  "testing_strategy": {"status": "passed", "note": "<rationale>"},
  "patterns": {"status": "passed", "note": "<rationale>"},
  "pitfalls": {"status": "passed", "note": "<rationale>"},
  "security_considerations": {"status": "passed", "note": "<rationale>"}
}
```

When the `task-reviewer` custom agent was dispatched, `reviewer_result` is the reviewer
agent's emitted structured JSON block (`schema_version`, `status`,
`issue_counts`, `issues[]`, `acceptance_criteria[]`, `project_checks[]`, and the
per-section `testing_strategy`/`patterns`/`pitfalls`/`security_considerations` verdicts) copied
verbatim and **merged** with the dispatch telemetry plus the derived legacy
summary fields. The structured fields are what the Kanban review queue renders
(issue list, acceptance verdicts, code-review checks); omitting them strips the
review down to a count with no detail. Extract the fenced ` ```json ` block per
the `stride-subagent-workflow` skill's "Extracting the structured review block"
— that section owns the legacy↔structured field mapping (e.g. `issues_found` =
the sum of the values in `issue_counts`, `acceptance_criteria_checked` = the
number of entries in `acceptance_criteria`). The structured block's schema
itself is owned by `agents/task-reviewer.agent.md`; do not redefine it here. The
legacy `acceptance_criteria_checked` and `issues_found` integers remain required
(for back-compat) when `dispatched` is `true`. If the reviewer emitted no
parseable ` ```json ` fence, fall back to the legacy-only envelope and omit the
structured keys — never invent them (see the `stride-subagent-workflow`
"Extracting the structured review block" fallback).

Copy exactly the keys the reviewer agent produced. An approved review still
emits `issues: []` and `project_checks: []` (the agent emits those arrays
unconditionally), so the empty arrays in the examples above are real, not
placeholders. But keys the agent did NOT emit — e.g. per-section
`testing_strategy`/`patterns`/`pitfalls`/`security_considerations` verdicts on schema versions that don't
produce them — must be omitted entirely, not sent as empty placeholders (per
the `stride-subagent-workflow` "Extracting the structured review block" section).

The same whole-object passthrough covers the **nested `security_considerations.considerations[]` breakdown** (reviewer schema 1.5+): when a deep security-considerations review ran (the stride-copilot-security-review considerations-mode dispatch merges its `consideration_verdicts` into `reviewer_result.security_considerations.considerations[]` — see `stride-workflow` Step 5), that nested array rides through to the `PATCH /complete` payload **automatically because the whole-object copy is verbatim** — do NOT add it as a separate enumerated key, and do NOT strip it. When no deep review ran (plugin absent, or the task's `security_considerations` was empty), the nested array is simply absent — it is never a hard-required field.

### Shape 2 — self-reported skip (for decision-matrix skips or no-custom-agent environments)

```json
{
  "dispatched": false,
  "reason": "<one of the 5 enum values below>",
  "summary": "<40+ non-whitespace characters explaining why and what was self-reported>"
}
```

The `reason` must be exactly one of:

| Reason | When to use |
|---|---|
| `no_subagent_support` | Platform has no subagent dispatch available (Codex/OpenCode graceful fallback) |
| `small_task_0_1_key_files` | Decision matrix: task is small with 0–1 key_files |
| `trivial_change_docs_only` | Docs-only change with no code impact |
| `self_reported_exploration` | Explored the codebase manually rather than dispatching the explorer agent |
| `self_reported_review` | Self-reviewed the diff against acceptance criteria rather than dispatching the reviewer agent |

Free-form reasons are rejected — the enum is the contract.

### Minimum summary length

Summaries must contain at least **40 non-whitespace characters**. Trivial summaries like `"explored files"` or `"reviewed code"` are rejected. The minimum is counted after stripping all whitespace, so inserting spaces does not help.

### 422 rejection example

When strict mode is on and a payload fails validation:

```json
{
  "error": "completion validation failed",
  "failures": [
    {
      "field": "explorer_result",
      "errors": [
        {"field": "summary", "message": "must be a string of at least 40 non-whitespace characters"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "required_format": { /* both shapes documented above */ },
  "documentation": "https://.../AI-WORKFLOW.md#completing-tasks"
}
```

### Grace-period rollout

Until the server flips `:strict_completion_validation` to true, missing or invalid `explorer_result`/`reviewer_result` produces a structured warning log but the request succeeds. **Emit the fields correctly now** — agents that lag the rollout will start getting 422 rejections on the flip day.

**Schema reference:** The `workflow_steps` array must match the schema documented in the `stride-workflow` skill — key-for-key. Always include one entry per step name (`explorer`, `planner`, `implementation`, `reviewer`, `after_doing`, `before_review`). Skipped steps use `{"name": "<step>", "dispatched": false, "reason": "<why>"}`.

**Optional:** Include `review_report` when a task-reviewer custom agent produced a structured review. Omit it when no review was performed (e.g., small tasks with 0-1 key_files).

## Recording Manual & Exploratory Testing Findings

When the orchestrator's **Step 5.5 (Manual & Exploratory Testing)** dispatched the `stride-copilot-exploratory-testing` plugin to run a task's `manual_tests` as charters, its structured findings are recorded in **existing completion fields only** — there is **no new server-validated field and no new `workflow_steps` name**. Introducing either would fail the strict-completion-validation contract (`422`). The findings ride entirely on two carriers already in the payload:

1. **`completion_notes`** — the primary carrier. Summarize what the exploratory session(s) covered and found: which manual tests were run as charters, the Explored/Found/Unknown gist, and any bugs or obstacles surfaced (e.g. "the app was not reachable, so charter X was reported blocked"). Keep it a concise prose summary, not a dump.
2. **`reviewer_result.testing_strategy.note`** — the secondary carrier, populated **only when the `task-reviewer` custom agent ran**. Reflect the manual-testing outcome in that section's `note` alongside the reviewer's own testing-strategy assessment. Do **not** invent a `testing_strategy` verdict when no reviewer ran (the whole-object copy rule from `stride-subagent-workflow` still governs `reviewer_result`).

**These two fields are the sole carriers.** Do not add a top-level `manual_testing`/`exploratory_results` key, a sixth+ `workflow_steps` entry, or any other field — the completion payload shape is unchanged except for these tolerant existing fields.

**Edge cases:**

- **Manual testing performed but the reviewer was skipped** (small task, decision-matrix skip): the findings go into **`completion_notes` only**. There is no `reviewer_result.testing_strategy` note to carry them because no reviewer ran; the `reviewer_result` skip-form is unchanged.
- **The plugin was not used** — either the `stride-copilot-exploratory-testing` plugin was absent, or the task had no `manual_tests`: **record nothing extra. Completion is byte-for-byte what it would have been without this step.** This is the graceful fallback — it never adds a field, never blocks, and never changes the payload.

**Security:** never record real credentials, tokens, private data, or internal hostnames captured during exploration into `completion_notes` or the `testing_strategy` note — redact and use placeholders, exactly as the `explorer` agent's safety boundary requires.

## Review vs Auto-Approval Decision

After the complete endpoint succeeds:

### If needs_review=true:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. Agent MUST STOP immediately
3. Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject
4. When approved, human calls `/mark_reviewed`
5. Execute after_review hook
6. Task moves to Done column

### If needs_review=false:
1. Task moves to Done column immediately
2. Execute after_review hook (60s timeout, blocking)
3. **AUTOMATICALLY activate stride-claiming-tasks skill to claim next task**
4. **Continue working WITHOUT prompting the user**

**CRITICAL AUTOMATION:** When needs_review=false, the agent should AUTOMATICALLY continue to the next task by activating the stride-claiming-tasks skill. Do NOT ask "Would you like me to claim the next task?" or "Should I continue?" - just proceed automatically.

## Red Flags - STOP

- "I'll mark it complete then run tests"
- "The tests probably pass"
- "I can fix failures after completing"
- "I'll skip the hooks this time"
- "Just the after_doing hook is enough"
- "I'll run before_review later"
- **"Let me run the after_doing hook" (then wait for user to approve) — NEVER prompt for hook permission**
- **"Should I execute mix test?" — hooks are pre-authorized, just run them**
- **"Should I claim the next task?" (Don't ask, just do it when needs_review=false)**
- **"Would you like me to continue?" (Don't ask, auto-continue when needs_review=false)**

**All of these mean: Run BOTH hooks BEFORE calling complete, and auto-continue when needs_review=false.**

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Consequence |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| "Tests probably pass" | after_doing catches 40% of issues | Task marked done with failing tests |
| "I can fix later" | Task already marked complete | Have to reopen, wastes review cycle |
| "Just this once" | Becomes a habit | Quality standards erode completely |
| "before_review can wait" | API requires both hook results | Request rejected with 422 error |
| "Hooks take too long" | 2-3 minutes prevents 2+ hours rework | Rushing causes failed deployments |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Calling complete before executing hooks
```bash
❌ curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete
   # Then running hooks afterward

✅ # Execute after_doing hook first
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Execute before_review hook second
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Then call complete WITH both results
   curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete -d '{...both results...}'
```

### Mistake 2: Only including after_doing result
```json
❌ {
  "after_doing_result": {...}
}

✅ {
  "after_doing_result": {...},
  "before_review_result": {...}
}
```

### Mistake 3: Continuing work after needs_review=true
```bash
❌ PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
   Agent continues to claim next task

✅ PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
   Agent STOPS and waits for human review
```

### Mistake 4: Manually executing hooks when plugin is installed
```bash
❌ Agent reads .stride.md, runs "mix test" and "mix credo" manually
   Agent captures exit code and duration
   Agent then makes the complete curl call
   (This duplicates what hooks.json does automatically)

✅ Agent just makes the complete curl call directly:
   curl -X PATCH .../api/tasks/:id/complete -d '{...}'
   (hooks.json PreToolUse auto-runs after_doing via stride-hook.sh
    hooks.json PostToolUse auto-runs before_review via stride-hook.sh)
```

### Mistake 5: Prompting user for permission to run hooks (without plugin)
```bash
❌ Agent says "Let me run the after_doing hooks" then waits for user approval
❌ Agent asks "Should I execute mix test?"
❌ Agent presents hook commands and pauses for confirmation

✅ Agent reads .stride.md after_doing section
   Agent immediately executes each command
   No announcement, no confirmation, no waiting
   (The user authored these hooks — they are pre-authorized)
```

### Mistake 6: Not fixing hook failures
```bash
❌ after_doing fails with test errors
   Agent calls complete endpoint anyway

✅ after_doing fails with test errors
   Agent fixes tests, re-runs hook until success
   Only then calls complete endpoint
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Complete all work** - Implementation finished
2. **Execute after_doing hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Run tests, linters, build (DO NOT prompt user)
3. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
4. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
5. **Execute before_review hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Create PR, generate docs (DO NOT prompt user)
6. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
7. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
8. **Call complete endpoint** - Include BOTH hook results
9. **Check needs_review flag** - Stop if true, continue if false
10. **If false:** Execute after_review hook AUTOMATICALLY (DO NOT prompt user)
11. **Claim next task** - Continue the workflow

## Real-World Impact

**Before this skill (completing without hooks):**
- 40% of completions had failing tests
- 2.3 hours average time to fix post-completion
- 65% required reopening and rework

**After this skill (hooks before complete):**
- 2% of completions had issues
- 15 minutes average fix time (pre-completion)
- 5% required rework

**Time savings: 2+ hours per task (90% reduction in post-completion rework)**

## Completion Request Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | string | Yes | Name of the completing agent |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Yes | Actual time spent on the task |
| `completion_notes` | string | Yes | Summary of what was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Yes | Brief summary for tracking |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | Yes | `"small"`, `"medium"`, or `"large"` |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Yes | Comma-separated file paths (NOT an array) |
| `changed_files` | array | No | Per-file diff entries — see the **Per-File Diff Capture** section below |
| `after_doing_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `before_review_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `workflow_steps` | array | Yes | Telemetry array with one entry per step name. See stride-workflow skill for full schema. |
| `explorer_result` | object | Yes | `task-explorer` custom agent dispatch result OR self-reported skip. See Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section. |
| `reviewer_result` | object | Yes | `task-reviewer` custom agent dispatch result OR self-reported skip. See Explorer/Reviewer Result Schema section. |
| `review_report` | string | No | Structured review report from task-reviewer custom agent. Include when a review was performed; omit when no review was done. |
| `skills_version` | string | No | Your skills version from SKILL.md frontmatter |

**WRONG — actual_files_changed as array:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": ["lib/foo.ex", "lib/bar.ex"]
```

**RIGHT — actual_files_changed as comma-separated string:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex"
```

## Per-File Diff Capture (Optional)

The completion payload accepts an optional top-level `changed_files` array — one
entry per file the agent touched, with the unified-patch text alongside the
path. The Stride server is the consumer; the review-queue UI renders these
diffs inline so reviewers approve or reject without leaving Stride.

The full encoding rules — field shape, the 500-line truncation marker, the
binary-file placeholder, and the backward-compatibility guarantees — live in
the contract doc and are the single source of truth:

> **Contract:** [`docs/diff-contract.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheezy/kanban/refs/heads/main/docs/diff-contract.md)
> (defines `path` / `diff` keys, exact truncation marker string, exact binary
> placeholder string, the 500-line inclusive cap, and the optional-field rules)

**How the stride-copilot plugin produces this data.** After a successful
`after_doing` hook the plugin captures the agent's working-tree state versus
the `$TASK_BASE_REF` anchor — committed changes, staged-but-uncommitted
changes, modified-but-unstaged changes, AND untracked-new files (not in
`.gitignore`) all surface in a single snapshot. Untracked new files appear
as synthesized new-file unified patches (diffed against `/dev/null`);
untracked binaries use the binary placeholder. The plugin applies the
contract's truncation and binary conventions and writes the JSON array to
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride-changed-files.json`. The snapshot is per-project,
refreshed at the end of every `after_doing`, and cleaned up on `after_review`.

**Working-tree semantic (v1.15.0+).** The snapshot reflects the agent's full
working state at completion time, regardless of commit state. An agent that
edits a file and calls `/complete` WITHOUT committing first still produces a
populated snapshot — the diff is captured from the working tree against
`$TASK_BASE_REF`, not from `..HEAD`. Earlier plugin versions (≤ 1.14.x)
required a commit before completion or the snapshot was empty.

**Why inline?** The PreToolUse-on-complete hook fires `after_doing` BEFORE
the curl runs. The hook writes `.stride-changed-files.json` during that
phase. If the agent's payload assembly reads the snapshot in a SEPARATE Bash
tool call BEFORE the curl call, that earlier Bash invocation runs BEFORE the
PreToolUse hook fires — so the file may not yet exist (or contains a stale
snapshot from a prior task). The fix is to inline the `cat` inside the same
curl invocation, so the read happens AFTER the PreToolUse hook has populated
the file but BEFORE the request body is serialized.

**How to populate `changed_files` in your payload.** Inline the snapshot read
inside the curl invocation using `jq -n --argjson cf`, with the absolute
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` path so the read works regardless of the Bash call's
CWD:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$STRIDE_API_URL/api/tasks/$TASK_ID/complete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRIDE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -n \
    --argjson cf "$(cat "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.stride-changed-files.json" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')" \
    --arg summary 'completion summary text' \
    --arg notes 'completion notes text' \
    '{
       completion_summary: $summary,
       completion_notes: $notes,
       changed_files: $cf,
       actual_complexity: "small"
     }')"
```

If `.stride-changed-files.json` is absent — older plugin install, non-git
project, capture failed, jq missing on the agent's machine — the inlined
`|| echo '[]'` fallback produces an empty array. Empty `changed_files` is a
valid shape; the server accepts it. Do NOT synthesize diffs by hand to "fill
in" the field; emit only what the plugin captured (or `[]`). Both shapes
below are valid completions:

```json
"changed_files": [
  {"path": "lib/foo.ex", "diff": "--- a/lib/foo.ex\n+++ b/lib/foo.ex\n@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@\n defmodule Foo do\n+  @moduledoc \"Foo\"\n end\n"},
  {"path": "assets/logo.png", "diff": "[binary file — no diff captured]"}
]
```

```json
"changed_files": []
```

**Backward compatibility.** `changed_files` is strictly optional. Completion
payloads that omit it remain fully valid forever — the server treats the
absence as "no diff data available" and the review queue shows the file list
from `actual_files_changed` without an inline diff panel.

## Hook Result Format Reminder

Both `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` use the same format:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `exit_code` | integer | Yes | 0 for success, non-zero for failure |
| `output` | string | Yes | stdout/stderr output from hook execution |
| `duration_ms` | integer | Yes | How long the hook took in milliseconds |

**WRONG — missing required fields:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {"output": "tests passed"}
```

**RIGHT — all three fields present:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {
  "exit_code": 0,
  "output": "All 230 tests passed\nmix credo --strict: no issues",
  "duration_ms": 45678
}
```

## Handling Stale Skills

The API response may include a `skills_update_required` field when your skills are outdated:

**When you see `skills_update_required`:**
1. Pull the latest stride-copilot repository: `cd stride-copilot && git pull origin main`
2. Retry your original action

## Arriving from stride-workflow

If you are following the `stride-workflow` orchestrator, you arrive here at **Step 6-7** with all prerequisites already satisfied:
- Task was claimed with proper before_doing hook (Step 2)
- Codebase was explored and patterns identified (Step 3)
- Implementation is complete (Step 4)
- Self-review was performed against acceptance criteria (Step 5)

**You can proceed directly to hook execution and completion.** The orchestrator has already guided you through all prior steps.

## Previous Skill Before Completing (Standalone Mode)

If you are using this skill standalone (not via the orchestrator), you should have already activated:

1. **`stride-workflow`** (recommended) — The orchestrator handles the full lifecycle. If you used it, you've already completed all prior steps.
2. **`stride-claiming-tasks`** — To claim the task with proper before_doing hook execution
3. **`stride-subagent-workflow`** — To explore, plan, and review based on the decision matrix

If you skipped prior workflow steps, the after_doing hook is likely to fail. Go back and verify.
