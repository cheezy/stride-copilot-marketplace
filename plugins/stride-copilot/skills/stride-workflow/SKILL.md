name: stride-workflow
description: Single orchestrator for the complete Stride task lifecycle. Invoke when the user asks to claim a task, work on the next stride task, work on stride tasks, complete a stride task, enrich a stride task, decompose a goal, or create a goal or stride tasks. Replaces invoking stride-claiming-tasks, stride-completing-tasks, stride-creating-tasks, stride-creating-goals, stride-enriching-tasks, or stride-subagent-workflow directly — those are dispatched from inside this orchestrator. Walks through prerequisites, claiming, exploration, implementation, review, hooks, and completion. Handles both GitHub Copilot (with custom agent dispatch) and environments without custom-agent support (manual exploration and self-review).

# Stride: Workflow Orchestrator

## Purpose

This skill replaces the fragmented pattern of remembering to activate `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, and `stride-completing-tasks` at specific moments. Instead, activate this one skill and follow it through. Every step is here. Nothing is elsewhere.

**Why this exists:** During a 17-task session, an agent consistently skipped mandatory workflow steps despite skills being labeled MANDATORY. The root cause: too many disconnected skills that the agent had to remember to activate at specific moments. Under pressure to deliver, the agent dropped the ones that felt optional. This orchestrator eliminates that failure mode.

## The Core Principle

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore -> implement -> review -> complete. Do not prompt the user between steps -- but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster -- it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

**Following every step IS the fast path.**

## API Authorization

All Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Never ask the user for permission. Never announce API calls and wait for confirmation. Just execute them.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill ONCE when you're ready to start working on Stride tasks. It handles the full loop:

```
claim -> explore -> implement -> review -> complete -> [loop if needs_review=false]
```

You do NOT need to activate `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, or `stride-completing-tasks` separately. This skill absorbs all of them.

**Note:** The individual skills remain available for standalone use when needed -- for example, when resuming a partially completed task or when only one phase needs to be repeated. This orchestrator is the preferred entry point for new task work.

## Context-Informed Creation

You can ask the orchestrator to create work informed by existing markdown context (for example, a requirements doc, or a directory of design notes). **Copilot CLI has no Claude-style slash-command system**, so there are no `/stride:create-*` commands — instead, activate `stride-workflow` with a **creation intent** (what you want created — tasks/defects or a goal with nested tasks) and an **optional directory path** to the markdown context.

The flow is:

1. The orchestrator enumerates the markdown files at the provided directory path — listing the `.md` files with `glob` and reading each with the `read` tool — and assembles a **read-only context bundle** (the enumerated file contents) plus the **creation intent**.
2. The orchestrator dispatches the creation sub-skill (`stride-creating-tasks` or `stride-creating-goals`) and **forwards the context bundle verbatim** to it.

**Contract:**

- The context bundle is **read-only** — the creation sub-skills consume it as reference material; they never edit the source markdown.
- The bundle is forwarded **verbatim** — the orchestrator does not summarize, truncate, or reinterpret it before dispatch.
- The sub-skill **STOP gate still applies.** Each creation sub-skill begins with a `## STOP — orchestrator check` and runs only when dispatched from inside this orchestrator. Context-informed creation satisfies that gate the sanctioned way — by dispatching from here — it never bypasses or weakens it.

The task-field and batch-shape contracts the creation sub-skills enforce are **not** duplicated here — they live in `stride-creating-tasks` and `stride-creating-goals`.

---

## Step 0: Prerequisites Check

**Verify these files exist before any API calls:**

1. **`.stride_auth.md`** -- Contains API URL and Bearer token
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Extract: `STRIDE_API_URL` and `STRIDE_API_TOKEN`

2. **`.stride.md`** -- Contains hook commands for each lifecycle phase
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Verify sections exist: `## before_doing`, `## after_doing`, `## before_review`, `## after_review`, `## after_goal`

**This step runs once per session, not once per task.**

---

## Step 1: Task Discovery

**Call `GET /api/tasks/next` to find the next available task.**

Review the returned task completely:
- `title`, `description`, `why`, `what`
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `key_files` -- which files you'll modify
- `patterns_to_follow` -- code patterns to replicate
- `pitfalls` -- what NOT to do
- `testing_strategy` -- how to test
- `verification_steps` -- how to verify
- `needs_review` -- whether human approval is needed after completion
- `complexity` -- guides how much exploration to do
- `technical_details` -- optional free-form technical context the author/enricher recorded (not a scored field; may be empty)

**Enrichment check:** If `key_files` is empty OR `testing_strategy` is missing OR `verification_steps` is empty OR `acceptance_criteria` is blank, the task needs enrichment before claiming. Well-specified tasks skip this check.

#### Copilot CLI: Invoke the Enricher Agent

1. **Invoke the `task-enricher` custom agent** (`agents/task-enricher.agent.md`) with the task identifier and the sparse fields (title, type, description, priority if set). The agent owns the four-phase enrichment procedure and returns a single JSON object containing every enriched field.
2. **Submit the returned JSON via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`** to populate the missing fields on the existing task. The agent does NOT call the API itself.
3. Re-fetch the task with `GET /api/tasks/:id` and verify all required fields are populated before proceeding to Step 2.

#### Other Environments: Activate the Enrichment Skill

1. Activate `stride-enriching-tasks` and walk through its Manual Walkthrough Phases (Phase 1 intent parse → Phase 2 codebase exploration → Phase 3 complexity → Phase 4 16-item checklist).
2. Submit the assembled JSON via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` per the API Integration block in that skill.

---

## Step 2: Claim the Task

1. Read `.stride.md` `## before_doing` section
2. Execute each command line immediately via the terminal -- no permission prompts, no confirmation
3. Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. If hook fails (non-zero exit): fix the issue, re-run -- do NOT proceed
5. Call `POST /api/tasks/claim` with the captured `before_doing_result`:

```json
{
  "identifier": "<task identifier>",
  "agent_name": "GitHub Copilot",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "<captured output>",
    "duration_ms": <captured duration>
  }
}
```

---

## Step 3: Explore the Codebase

**This step is NOT optional for medium+ tasks.**

### Goal / Large Undecomposed Task

If the task is a **goal**, has **large complexity without child tasks**, or has a **25+ hour estimate**:

1. Analyze the task scope manually
2. Break it into subtasks and create them via `POST /api/tasks/batch`
3. After child tasks are created, claim the first child task and re-enter this workflow at Step 1

**Do NOT implement goals directly. Decompose first.**

### Small Task, 0-1 Key Files

Skip exploration. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Implementation).

### All Other Tasks (medium+, OR 2+ key_files)

1. **Read each file** listed in `key_files` to understand current state
2. **Search for patterns** mentioned in `patterns_to_follow`
3. **Find related test files** for the modules you'll modify
4. **For medium+ tasks**, outline your implementation approach before coding

**Take notes on what you find.** This exploration informs your implementation and prevents wrong approaches that waste 2+ hours.

---

## Step 4: Implementation

**Now write code.** Use what you learned in Step 3 to guide your work.

Follow:
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `patterns_to_follow` -- replicate existing patterns
- `pitfalls` -- avoid what the task author warned about
- `testing_strategy` -- write the tests specified
- `key_files` -- modify the files listed

**This is the only step where you write code. All other steps are setup, verification, or completion.**

---

## Step 5: Self-Review

**Before running hooks, verify your changes against the task spec.**

Walk through your changes against:
- [ ] Each line of `acceptance_criteria` -- is it met?
- [ ] Each item in `pitfalls` -- did you avoid it?
- [ ] `patterns_to_follow` -- does your code match?
- [ ] `testing_strategy` -- did you write the specified tests?

**Small tasks (0-1 key_files):** A quick scan is sufficient. Medium+ tasks need a thorough review.

---

## Step 6: Execute Hooks

**Execute each hook immediately -- no permission prompts, no confirmation.**

### Hooks Reference

The five recognized `.stride.md` hook sections, in lifecycle order:

| Hook | Fires | Blocking | Timeout | Purpose |
|---|---|:---:|---|---|
| `## before_doing` | After `POST /api/tasks/claim` succeeds | yes | 60s | Pull latest, install deps, ensure clean working tree |
| `## after_doing` | Before `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` runs | yes | 120s | Run tests, lint, build — quality gate before completion |
| `## before_review` | After `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` succeeds | yes | 60s | Generate PR, post artifacts, notify reviewers |
| `## after_review` | After `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/mark_reviewed` succeeds | yes | 60s | Merge, deploy, cleanup |
| `## after_goal` | After the parent goal's final child task completes | yes | 60s | Project-level rollups, goal-completion notifications, archival |

A missing `## after_goal` section parses as a clean no-op (`exit_code: 0`, empty output) — older `.stride.md` files that predate the section keep working without modification. The plugin's `hooks/stride-hook.sh` and `stride-hook.ps1` detect the `after_goal` entry in the response payload of `/complete` or `/mark_reviewed` and execute it automatically when present (W788/W789).

### Hook Environment Variables

The server populates `hook.env` and the plugin forwards every key into the child process environment. The variable set differs by hook (`TASK_*` for the four task-scoped hooks, `GOAL_*` for `after_goal`); `BOARD_*`, `COLUMN_*`, `AGENT_NAME`, and `HOOK_NAME` are present across all five.

| Variable | `before_doing` / `after_doing` / `before_review` / `after_review` | `after_goal` |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| `HOOK_NAME`, `AGENT_NAME` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `BOARD_ID`, `BOARD_NAME` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `COLUMN_ID`, `COLUMN_NAME` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `TASK_ID`, `TASK_IDENTIFIER`, `TASK_TITLE`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION` | ✓ | — |
| `TASK_STATUS`, `TASK_COMPLEXITY`, `TASK_PRIORITY`, `TASK_NEEDS_REVIEW` | ✓ | — |
| `GOAL_ID`, `GOAL_IDENTIFIER`, `GOAL_TITLE`, `GOAL_DESCRIPTION` | — | ✓ |

Server-supplied values are the single source of truth — the plugin does not invent, derive, or look up any of these client-side. A key the server omits is exported as an empty string (defined-but-empty), never raised as an error.

### Canonical Hook Examples

The hooks are general-purpose — any shell command is fair game. The examples below are common starting points, not the only valid uses.

````markdown
## before_review

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "$TASK_IDENTIFIER: $TASK_TITLE" \
  --body "Implements $TASK_IDENTIFIER."
```

## after_goal

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "$GOAL_IDENTIFIER: $GOAL_TITLE" \
  --body "Rolls up the completed goal $GOAL_IDENTIFIER ($GOAL_TITLE).

  $GOAL_DESCRIPTION"
```
````

`## after_goal` is not coupled to PR creation. Other valid uses include posting to Slack with `curl`, archiving artifacts, kicking off a release pipeline, or running a project-level smoke test. The blocking semantics (60s timeout, non-zero exit keeps the goal In Progress for retry) apply to whatever command you choose.

### after_doing hook (blocking, 120s timeout)

1. Read `.stride.md` `## after_doing` section
2. Execute each command line one at a time via the terminal
3. Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

### before_review hook (blocking, 60s timeout)

1. Read `.stride.md` `## before_review` section
2. Execute each command line one at a time via the terminal
3. Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

### Hook Failure

When a hook fails:
- Read the error output carefully
- Fix the root cause (test failures, lint errors, build issues)
- Re-run the hook to verify the fix
- Never skip a blocking hook or call complete with a failed hook result

---

## Step 7: Complete the Task

Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` with ALL required fields:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "GitHub Copilot",
  "time_spent_minutes": 45,
  "completion_notes": "Summary of what was done and key decisions made.",
  "completion_summary": "Brief one-line summary for tracking.",
  "actual_complexity": "medium",
  "actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex, test/foo_test.exs",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "after_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "<captured from Step 6>",
    "duration_ms": <captured from Step 6>
  },
  "before_review_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "<captured from Step 6>",
    "duration_ms": <captured from Step 6>
  },
  "explorer_result": {
    "dispatched": true,
    "summary": "Explored the 3 key_files and identified the existing pattern to mirror",
    "duration_ms": 12000
  },
  "reviewer_result": {
    "dispatched": true,
    "summary": "Reviewed the diff against all acceptance criteria and pitfalls",
    "duration_ms": 8000,
    "acceptance_criteria_checked": 5,
    "issues_found": 0
  },
  "workflow_steps": [
    {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 12450},
    {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 8200},
    {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1820000},
    {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 15300},
    {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 45678},
    {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 2340}
  ]
}
```

**Required fields:**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_name` | string | Your agent name |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Actual time spent |
| `completion_notes` | string | What was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Brief summary |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | "small", "medium", or "large" |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Comma-separated paths (NOT an array) |
| `after_doing_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `before_review_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `explorer_result` | object | `task-explorer` custom agent dispatch result or skip-form — see `stride-completing-tasks` for full shape and skip-reason enum |
| `reviewer_result` | object | `task-reviewer` custom agent dispatch result or skip-form — see `stride-completing-tasks` for full shape and skip-reason enum |
| `workflow_steps` | array | Six-entry telemetry array — see **Workflow Telemetry** section below |

---

## Step 8: Post-Completion Decision

### If `needs_review=true`:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. **STOP.** Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject.
3. When approved, `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/mark_reviewed` is called (by human or system)
4. Execute `after_review` hook
5. Task moves to Done

### If `needs_review=false`:
1. Task moves to Done immediately
2. Execute `after_review` hook from `.stride.md`
3. **Loop back to Step 1** -- claim the next task and repeat the full workflow

**Do not ask the user whether to continue. Do not ask "Should I claim the next task?" Just proceed.**

### If this completion finishes the parent goal's last child task

When the just-completed task is the **final child of a parent goal**, the server bundles a fifth `after_goal` entry in the response of `/complete` (when `needs_review=false`) or `/mark_reviewed` (when `needs_review=true`), alongside the primary hooks. The plugin's hook bridge auto-detects this entry and executes the local `## after_goal` section as a blocking hook (same shape as `after_doing` / `before_review`).

The hook captures `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` and emits the structured result on stdout. To flip the parent goal to Done, the agent must then POST that result:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$STRIDE_API_URL/api/tasks/$GOAL_ID/after_goal" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STRIDE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$AFTER_GOAL_RESULT_JSON"
```

`$GOAL_ID` is supplied in the hook's `GOAL_ID` / `GOAL_IDENTIFIER` env vars (see Step 6's env-var matrix). A `2xx` with `exit_code == 0` transitions the goal to Done. A `2xx` with `exit_code != 0` records the failure on the goal's `after_goal_attempts` audit log and leaves the goal In Progress for the user to investigate and re-trigger.

**Back-compat (matters for agent runtimes that predate this feature):**

- If `.stride.md` has no `## after_goal` section, the hook bridge silently no-ops — no JSON is emitted, no POST is needed. The server's grace-window worker (configured per board, typically a few minutes) will promote the goal to Done automatically.
- If the agent doesn't POST the result at all (older plugin versions, scripted environments), the same grace-window worker covers the gap. The goal transitions to Done after the wait expires, with `after_goal_status: :succeeded` and a synthetic attempt tagged `source: "after_goal_grace_worker"` in the audit log.
- The `## after_goal` hook is general-purpose — Slack notifications, artifact archival, release pipelines, project-level smoke tests are all valid uses. See Step 6's "Canonical Hook Examples" for shape references.

---

## Workflow Telemetry: The `workflow_steps` Array

Every task completion **must** include a `workflow_steps` array in the `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` payload. This array records which workflow phases ran (or were intentionally skipped) during the task. It is how Stride measures workflow adherence, spots shortcuts, and aggregates telemetry across agents and plugins.

**Build the array incrementally as you progress through the workflow.** Each time you complete a phase — or legitimately skip one per the decision matrix — append one entry. Submit the completed six-entry array in Step 7.

### Step Name Vocabulary

The `name` field must be one of these six values. Do not invent new names — consistency across plugins is the only reason telemetry can be aggregated.

| Step name | When to record it | Orchestrator step |
|---|---|---|
| `explorer` | Codebase exploration (manual file reads of `key_files`) | Step 3 |
| `planner` | Implementation planning (manual outline of approach before coding) | Step 3 |
| `implementation` | Writing code | Step 4 |
| `reviewer` | Code review (self-review against acceptance criteria) | Step 5 |
| `after_doing` | The `after_doing` hook execution | Step 6 |
| `before_review` | The `before_review` hook execution | Step 6 |

### Per-Step Schema

Each element of `workflow_steps` is an object with these keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Always | One of the six vocabulary values above |
| `dispatched` | boolean | Always | `true` if the step ran; `false` if intentionally skipped |
| `duration_ms` | integer | When `dispatched=true` | Wall-clock time the step took, in milliseconds |
| `reason` | string | When `dispatched=false` | Short explanation of why the step was skipped |

### End-of-Workflow Example (full dispatch)

A medium-complexity task that exercised every phase:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 12450},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 8200},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 1820000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 15300},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 45678},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 2340}
]
```

### End-of-Workflow Example (small task, decision matrix skips)

A small task with 0-1 key_files that legitimately skipped exploration, planning, and review per the exploration guide in Step 3:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 620000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 38200},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1900}
]
```

### Rules

- Always include **all six** step names. Skipped steps are recorded with `dispatched: false` — never omitted.
- Record entries in the order the steps occurred in the workflow (the order listed in the vocabulary table above).
- When `dispatched: false`, the `reason` must describe **why** the step was skipped (e.g., decision matrix rule, task metadata, platform constraint) — not merely restate that it was skipped.
- A missing `workflow_steps` array, or one with fewer than six entries, indicates an incomplete telemetry record.

---

## Explorer and Reviewer Result Rollout

Every `/complete` payload **must** include `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` as top-level objects. Both are pre-validated by `Kanban.Tasks.CompletionValidation` on the server. The full shape (dispatched-custom-agent vs. self-reported skip), the 40-character non-whitespace summary rule, and the five-value skip-reason enum live in the `stride-completing-tasks` skill — this orchestrator does not duplicate them.

When the `task-reviewer` custom agent was dispatched, the structured `reviewer_result` carries the per-section verdicts the Kanban review queue renders — `testing_strategy`, `patterns`, `pitfalls`, and `security_considerations` (each `passed` | `failed` | `not_assessed`) — at `schema_version "1.4"`, copied verbatim from the reviewer's fenced ```json block. Extract that block per the `stride-subagent-workflow` skill's "Extracting the structured review block" section (which owns the field map, the worked example, the JSON-parse-failure omit-list, and the D66 `acceptance_criteria` count self-check); the block's schema is owned by `agents/task-reviewer.agent.md`.

**Re-review rounds (D66):** if you re-dispatch the reviewer after a `changes_requested` round, pass the task's `acceptance_criteria` field **unchanged** and require the reviewer to keep its `acceptance_criteria` array 1:1 with the task's canonical list (verbatim, in order, never split/merged/reworded/added/dropped). Re-deriving the criteria corrupts the persisted count — see the "Re-review and follow-up rounds" rule in `stride-subagent-workflow`.

The server is rolling out hard enforcement behind a feature flag `:strict_completion_validation`:

| Phase | Server behavior | Agent impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Grace (current)** | Missing or invalid results log a structured warning and the request succeeds | Emit the fields correctly now; the warning volume is a preview of the strict-mode rejection volume |
| **Strict (after all 5 plugins release)** | Missing or invalid results return `422` with a `failures` list | Any agent not emitting valid fields is locked out of completion |

**Why this matters for the orchestrator:** Steps 3 (explorer dispatch) and 5 (reviewer dispatch) already capture the durations and summaries needed for these fields. Persist those into `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` in the Step 7 payload. When the decision matrix skips a step — or when you self-explore/self-review — submit the skip form with a reason from the enum and a substantive summary explaining what you did instead. See `stride-completing-tasks` for the exact shape, rejection examples, and minimum-length rule.

---

## Edge Cases

### Hook failure mid-workflow
- Blocking hooks (`after_doing`, `before_review`) must pass before completion
- Fix the root cause, re-run the hook, then proceed
- Never skip a blocking hook or call complete with a failed hook result

### Task that needs_review=true
- Stop after Step 7. Do not claim the next task.
- The human reviewer will handle the review cycle.
- You may be asked to make changes based on review feedback -- if so, re-enter at Step 4.

### Goal type tasks
- Goals are decomposed, not implemented directly
- Break down manually into subtasks, create via `POST /api/tasks/batch`
- Each child task follows this full workflow independently

### Skills update required
- If any API response includes `skills_update_required`, update the plugin and retry

| Forgot to review | Agent jumped to completion | Step 5 is inline -- can't be missed |
| Wrong API fields | Agent guessed from memory | Step 7 has the exact format |
| Skipped hooks | Agent called complete directly | Step 6 blocks Step 7 |
| Asked user permission | Agent prompted between steps | Core principle says don't |
| Speed over process | Agent optimized for throughput | Every step is framed as mandatory |

## Red Flags -- STOP

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, go back and check what you skipped:

- "This is straightforward, I'll skip exploration" -- Medium+ tasks ALWAYS explore
- "I know the codebase" -- The task has specific pitfalls you haven't read yet
- "Self-review will slow me down" -- It catches what tests can't
- "I'll just run the hooks and complete" -- Did you explore? Did you review?
- "This step doesn't apply to me" -- Check the exploration guide, not your intuition

**The workflow IS the automation. Follow every step.**
