#
# Called by GitHub Copilot's PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks (configured in hooks.json).
# Receives hook JSON on stdin, determines if the Bash command is a Stride API call,

# Usage: echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"curl ..."}}' | stride-hook.sh <pre|post>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — Success (or not a Stride API call)
#   2 — Hook command failed (blocks the tool call in PreToolUse context)

# Emits a JSON array of `{path, diff}` entries to stdout, one per file that
# differs between $1 (base ref) and the agent's WORKING TREE at the time the
# function runs. The snapshot captures committed-since-base, staged-but-
# uncommitted, modified-but-unstaged, AND untracked-but-not-gitignored changes
# in a single pass — so reviewers see the agent's full working state at
# completion time, regardless of whether the agent committed before calling
# /complete. Truncates diffs over 500 lines with the contract marker; emits
# the binary placeholder for files git reports as binary in --numstat (tracked)
# or that contain a NUL byte (untracked). Falls back to HEAD~1 when the
# provided base is empty or unresolvable. Returns an empty array (and exit 0)
# for any degraded path (jq missing, git missing, not in a repo, no commits to
# diff) so callers can treat this strictly as "best-effort capture".
