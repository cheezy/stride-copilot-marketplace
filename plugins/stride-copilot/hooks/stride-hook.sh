# Called by GitHub Copilot's PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks (configured in hooks.json).
# Receives hook JSON on stdin, determines if the Bash command is a Stride API call,

# Usage: echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"curl ..."}}' | stride-hook.sh <pre|post>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — Success (or not a Stride API call)
#   2 — Hook command failed (blocks the tool call in PreToolUse context)
