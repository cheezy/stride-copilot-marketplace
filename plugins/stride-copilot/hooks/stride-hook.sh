# Usage: echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"curl ..."}}' | stride-hook.sh <pre|post>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — Success (or not a Stride API call)
#   2 — Hook command failed (blocks the tool call in PreToolUse context)

# complete (D118 fast path) and otherwise falls back to a fresh, hook-initiated
# GET /api/tasks/:id/after_goal_status that is immune to harness truncation
# (D119 — the reliability guarantee). route_after_goal keeps the two paths
# mutually exclusive so the section runs at most once. Missing `## after_goal`
# in .stride.md is a clean no-op (back-compat); the server's grace-window worker
# still covers goal completion when neither path can detect it. A non-zero
# section exit is surfaced via the structured JSON shape, never as a non-zero
# script exit (the primary curl already succeeded).
