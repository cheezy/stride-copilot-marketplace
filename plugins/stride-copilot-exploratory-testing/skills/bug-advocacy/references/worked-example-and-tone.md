# bug-advocacy — worked example and tone

Reference for the `bug-advocacy` skill (`skills/bug-advocacy/SKILL.md`): the severity rubric applied to real bugs, and the dispassionate-tone rule in full. Moved out of the skill so the explorer does not load it every time the skill does; the ladder, the modifiers, and the combination rule it applies stay in the skill.

## Worked example — rating the CSV import session

The three bugs from the plugin's example session sheet and example debrief (`fixtures/`), rated against the ladder. (The Moderate row is an added illustration — no bug in that session rated Moderate.)

| Bug | Worst demonstrated failure | Ladder clause matched | Modifiers | Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CSV import does not scope rows to the current tenant | `<tenant B>`'s exported rows accepted into `<tenant A>` with no tenant check | Critical — *data crossing a boundary that must contain it* | irrelevant; Critical is the ceiling | **Critical** |
| Non-UTF-8 CSVs import vendor names as mojibake | "Café" persisted as "CafÃ©" in the receipt list; it will export corrupt | High — *valid data persisted wrong, affected records still identifiable* | Reach: one UTF-16 file, not generalized — no. Avoidability: user can re-save as UTF-8 and repair the rows — no. Persistence: wrong state persists but is visible in the list — no. **0 of 3** | **High** |
| Truncated files drop the final partial row silently | 39 valid rows imported correctly; the partial 40th dropped with no warning | Minor — *only casualty is input the product could not have interpreted* | Reach: only truncated files — no. Avoidability: supply an intact file — no. Persistence: silent, but nothing wrong is left behind — no. **0 of 3** | **Minor** (provisional) |
| *(illustrative)* Receipt-list Date sort is ignored until the page is reloaded after an import | Clicking **Date** does not re-sort; a reload restores correct sorting | Moderate — *secondary feature broken while the primary path works* | none demonstrated | **Moderate** |

Three calibration notes, because these are the disagreements that actually happen:

- **Why the tenant leak is not High.** It was demonstrated exactly once, with two accounts and a CSV the tester built. None of that is mitigation — rule 3 of the skill's combination rule. A boundary that must hold did not hold.
- **Why the mojibake is not Critical.** No boundary was crossed, nothing was destroyed, and the affected records are identifiable and repairable. It is the High clause verbatim. It is also not Moderate: wrong data **persists**, which is exactly what separates High from Moderate.
- **Why the dropped row is Minor and not High.** Two High clauses pull at this one, and the word "silently" pulls hard toward both. The line in each case is *what the product accepted*.
  - Against the **valid-data-lost** clause: that clause covers data the product accepted as well-formed. A row cut mid-record was never that, and every valid row imported correctly. Had the import silently dropped a **complete, well-formed** row, it would be High.
  - Against the **false-report** clause: that clause covers a reported outcome that is false *about work the product accepted as well-formed*. Here the success report is true of everything accepted — all 39 valid rows imported. The product is silent about input it could not interpret, which is a gap in its reporting, not a false statement about the user's accepted work. Two variants would be High, and both turn on the product having accepted the work: reporting "40 rows imported" while importing 39; and reporting an unqualified "Import complete" while silently rejecting 5 **well-formed** rows on a business rule, since the user then believes 40 records are in their books when 35 are. "Accepted" means accepted as well-formed — not committed. A record the product parsed and then dropped was accepted; a row cut mid-record never was.

  The silence is what makes it a bug at all — that is the oracle's job. The demonstrated consequence is what sets the level — that is this rubric's job. Do not import the strength of the oracle violation into the severity.

## Say it clearly and dispassionately

Report the bug in neutral, precise language: what you did, what happened, why it is wrong. Nothing else. No blame, no sarcasm, no speculation about how anyone let this happen.

This is not politeness — it is **credibility, and credibility is the currency that gets your next bug fixed**. Inflated language costs it fastest. A reader who trips over "completely broken" and finds a broken filter learns to read your reports at a discount, and the discount is still applied when you file something that really is catastrophic.

**The severity field is where tone does the most damage**, because an inflated level is inflated language sitting in the one place a reader can check — and one Critical that a reader re-rates as Moderate teaches them to discount every Critical you file afterward, including the next real one. Spend no adjective that the demonstrated failure has not already earned: no all-caps, no exclamation marks, no "catastrophic" or "completely broken", and no level the ladder did not give you.

Deflation costs the same credibility from the other side — a Critical filed as Moderate to sound measured is not restraint, it is a boundary failure that someone will now schedule behind a typo.
